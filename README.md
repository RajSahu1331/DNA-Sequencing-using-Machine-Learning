# DNA Sequencing using Machine Learning
 DNA is a hereditary material in humans and most of the organisms. A human genome has about 6 billion characters or letters. If you think the genome(the complete DNA sequence) is like a book, it is a book about 6 billion letters of “A”, “C”, “G” and “T”. Now, everyone has a unique genome. Nevertheless, scientists find most parts of the human genomes are alike to each other.
